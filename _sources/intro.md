# Preface

This book ppresents a comprehensive introduction to cloud 
computing from an applied perspective. It discusses to some extent the 
underlying historical and theoretical foundations of cloud computing. 
Furthermore, the design, development, and deployment of several cloud 
deployment projects are discussed to showcase how these knowledge and 
technologies can be applied in relatively realistic scenarios. Hands-on
activities are provided to that readers can replicate these tasks. These 
projects are motivated by projects that CSC486 students developed. 

The above-mentioned projects are developed and tested using a M1 Mac Air
with 16 GB of memory. *In theory*, it is possible to do everything on a 
slightly weaker computer running on Windows.
