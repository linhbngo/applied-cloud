# Essential characteristics

The five essential characteristics of cloud computing are:
- C1: On-demand self-service
- C2: Broad network access
- C3: Resource pooling
- C4: Rapid elasticity
- C5: Measured service

As these essential characteristics help defining cloud computing, we 
can compare and contrast between cloud computing and traditional on-site 
physical servers by using an analogy that compares line of credits versus 
cash. 

The first important point to make based on this analogy is that while 
cash and line of credits are two different mediums, they both 
represent the same thing: buy power. In this sense, regardless of their 
differences, cloud computing and on-site physical servers also represent 
the same thing: **computing power**.
