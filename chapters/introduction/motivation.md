# Motivation

Imagine that you are the CEO and front-end developer and back-end developer 
and QA engineer and many other things of this new unicorn startup. You are 
confident that your company will grow to rival the likes of Amazon and Google
(or enough to get bought out by them!).

Time is of the essence. You want to get your product live as soon as possible 
to capture the market and attract the attention of investors. Long gone are 
the days where one needs to spending time getting a garage operation going. 
At this day and age, cloud is the way to go.
