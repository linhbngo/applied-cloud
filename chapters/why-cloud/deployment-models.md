## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is a somewhat loaded term. In a naive interpretation, anything 
that provides computing-related services and is not physically hosted or aware of 
by the entity using the services can be considered a cloud service. The National 
Institute of Standards and Technology provides the following definition for cloud 
computing:

```{important}
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network 
access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, 
storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released 
with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

This cloud model is composed of:
- Five essential characteristics
- Three service models
- Four deployment models
```
